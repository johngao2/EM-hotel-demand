## Current Objective (subject to change):
Implement EM algorithm (van Ryzin, Vulcano 2017) to forecast customer preferences given product assortments at each time step, **and do it quick**. Transaction data is simulated.

## Background:
**Original EM paper:**

**Newer, problem-specific EM algorithm (what I'm trying to reproduce and extend):**

estimate a rank-based choice model of demand, *Operations Research 65 (2017), no. 2*, 396â€“407. Retrieved from https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.2016.1559

## Tools:
IPOPT: Fast open source non-linear programming solver. https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt, https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt

CPPAD: Fast open source package for computing derivatives. Needed since otherwise I'd have to code up gradients and hessians and whatnot D: to feed into IPOPT. https://coin-or.github.io/CppAD/doc/cppad.htm, https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD
