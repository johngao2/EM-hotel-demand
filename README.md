## Project Log:
#### Step 1: Implement simple multinomial logit go get familiar with likelihood maximization using CppAD and IPOPT packages. *(MNL_baseline > simple_mnl.cpp)*  **DONE**  
**Subtasks:**
- Run IPOPT solver on single problem. **DONE**
- Run IPOPT solver repeatedly on changing problem formulations. **DONE** 

#### Step 2: Replicate EM algorithm (van Ryzin, Vulcano 2017) on transaction data to forecast customer preferences given product assortments at each time step, **and do it quick**. Use on simulated and real datasets from the original paper, and compare results. *(censored_EM_replication > hotel5 > EM_hotel_5.cpp)*  **DONE**  
**Subtasks:** 
- Implement Uncensored EM on van Ryzin's hotel data, compare results. **DONE, BUT WITH ISSUES**
  - Check with closed form maximizer. **DONE; MAXIMIZER ISN'T THE PROBLEM**
  - If bug still isn't solved, run through algo on small by hand and track every number, then compare with algo output. **DONE; RESULTS REPLICATED, BUG SOLVED**
  - Debug vanishing taylor coefficient (scaling probably works) **DONE; NOT REALLY A PROBLEM ANYMORE; HAPPENS WAY AFTER CONVERGENCE**
- Implement censored EM on van Ryzin's simulated data, compare results.
  - Need to first simulate the data myself, following steps outlined in 5.1 (van Ryzin, Vulcano 2017)
- Extend censored EM to work on van Ryzin's hotel data.

#### Step 3: Extend van Ryzin & Vulcano to include seasonality and be fast enough to work on hotel problems where the assortment size is gigantic.
