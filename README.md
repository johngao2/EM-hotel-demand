## Project Overview:
~~Step 1: Implement simple multinomial logit go get familiar with likelihood maximization using CppAD and IPOPT packages.~~ **- Done**  

Step 2: Replicate EM algorithm (van Ryzin, Vulcano 2017) on transaction data to forecast customer preferences given product assortments at each time step, **and do it quick**. Use on simulated and real datasets from the original paper, and compare results.  

Step 3: Extend van Ryzin & Vulcano to include seasonality and be fast enough to work on hotel problems where the assortment size is gigantic.

**Tools:**  
IPOPT: Fast open source non-linear programming solver. https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt, https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt  

CPPAD: Fast open source package for computing derivatives. Needed since otherwise I'd have to code up gradients and hessians and whatnot D: to feed into IPOPT. https://coin-or.github.io/CppAD/doc/cppad.htm, https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD
